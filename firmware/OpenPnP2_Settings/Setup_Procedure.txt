0. [ Arduino ] Actuator firmware build and write
    Build OpenPnP_CL-Feeder_mega2560.ino and write it to Arduino mega2560.

1. [ OpenPnP2 ] Add a G-code driver
    1.1 Add GCodeAsyncDriver and set the name "CL-Feeder_Driver" in the Name area of the Configuration tab.
    1.2 Set "Line-Endings" to "LF" in the Communication method area of the Configuration tab.
    1.3 In the SerialPort area of the Configuration tab, set "Port" to the COM port that was added when the driver was connected.
    1.3 Set "Baud" to "115200" in the SerialPort area of the Configuration tab.

2. [ OpenPnP2 ] Add Actuator
    2.1 Add two "ReferenceActuator" and name them "CL-Feeder_PrePick", "CL-Feeder_PostPick
    2.2 Specify "CL-Feeder_Driver" as the "Driver" of the added actuators.

3. [ OpenPnP2 ] Add Actuator Settings
    3.1 Select "CL-Feeder_Driver" added to "Drivers".
    3.2 Select the "Gcode" tab, and select "CL-Feeder_PrePick" from the "Head Mountable" drop-down list.
    3.3 Select "COMMAND_DOUBLE_COMMAND" from the "Setting" drop-down list.
    3.4 Add "M600 N{IntegerValue} S1"

    3.5 Select the "Gcode" tab, and select "CL-Feeder_PostPick" from the "Head Mountable" drop-down list.
    3.6 Select "COMMAND_DOUBLE_COMMAND" from the "Setting" drop-down list.
    3.7 Add "M600 N{IntegerValue} S0"

4. [ OpenPnP2 ] Adding and configuring feeders
    4.1 Set "CL-Feeder_PrePick" to "Feed" of "Actuator" in the "Actuators" area.
    4.2 Set "CL-Feeder_PostPick" to "Post Pick" of "Actuator" in the "Actuators" area.
    4.3 In the "Feeders" tab, add "ReferenceAutoFeeder".
        Write the slot number in the "Actuator Value" in the "Actuators" area. The two numbers must have the same value.
    4.4 Repeat section 4.3 for the number of slots.

5. [ OpenPnP2 ] Check if it works
    5.1 Click on "CL-Feeder_PrePick" in the "Actuators" tab under "Machine Controls
    5.2 Enter a slot number (e.g. 0) in the "Set value" field and press the "Set" button.
    5.3 Confirm that the Arduino port corresponding to slot 0 is set to "High" level. (The attached firmware changes the level of GPIO33.)

    5.4 Click "CL-Feeder_PostPick" in the "Actuators" tab under "Machine Controls".
    5.5 Enter a slot number (e.g. 0) in the "Set value" field and press the "Set" button.
    5.6 Confirm that the Arduino port corresponding to slot 0 is set to "Low" level. (The attached firmware changes the level of GPIO33.)

6. Enjoy!
